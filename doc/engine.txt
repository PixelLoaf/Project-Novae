Information about the game engine and how it will work.

Each character (including players, enemies, etc.) will be laid out as such:

KinematicBody: Base body of the character. Only collides with tiles. 
|              Does NOT represent the hitbox.
|
|-CollisionShape2D: Collision shape for the character. 
|
|-Area2D: Represents the Hitbox. will detect collision with other characters, 
| |       bullets, enemies, players, etc. depending on what it needs to collide 
| |       with.
| |
| \-CollisionShape2D: Collision shape for the hitbox.
|
|-...: anything else that the character needs, e.g. sprites, weapons, etc.

Note that characters should have circular body shapes. That way if the player
rotates or something to that effect, then that character is guaranteed to not
get lodged into a wall. The hitbox can be any shape since it does not determine
collision with solid objects.

The following collision layers are defined:
1 - solid objects
2 - players
3 - enemies

Setting a layer to one of the above means that the object IS that thing. If the
layer is set to 'players,' for example, then that object SHOULD BE a player, or
a player-like object (such as a partner NPC).

Setting a mask to one of the above means that the object WILL COLLIDE with that
thing. If the layer is set to 'players,' for example, then that object SHOULD
collide with players. For example, a bullet, coin, powerup, etc.
